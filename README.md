#Visualarity

This is a work in progress "spec script" for an update of visualarity.com. For now this has nothing to do with them and is not an offical/sanctionned site.

I'm making this as a side project to 

- 'warm up' - haven't done web in a while, i'm pretty rusty
- get used to and evaluate jekyll for this type of project
- Ad the same time i'm documenting and keeping (At least trying to) a log to get an idea of my productivity. See how long things actually take.

I guess you're free to do whatever you want with the code - the data isn't mine

There's still a lot of work to do.

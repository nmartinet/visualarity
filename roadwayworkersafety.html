        <p>
          Visualarity Communications Inc.'s ROADWAY WORKER ON-TRACK SAFETY TRAINING Program was designed specifically to respond to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Regulation 49 CFR 214 which was drafted to protect anyone working on or near railroad tracks with the ultimate goal of reducing rail related accidents and fatalities. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, this regulation states that all personnel working on or near railroad tracks must be trained once every calendar year. Railroads and contractors to railroads must ensure their employees receive this training and that records be kept. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines to both the employer and the employees.</p>

          Since the law requires that you take the course every calendar year, we have made it easy for you to re-train. If you have taken our CD-Rom training previously, you are eligible for our new condensed re-training program. This quicker paced program can be completed in a few hours thus ensuring you remain a certified Roadway Worker. The re-training program is offered at the reduced cost of $75.00 US (S&H extra). A small price to pay for your life!
